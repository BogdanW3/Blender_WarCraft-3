# Blender_WarCraft-3
2.8x* port of PavelBlend's mdx-importer
install by dropping the "io_scene_warcraft_3" folder in C:\Users\YOU_USER\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.8X\scripts\addons



* I have only tested it with 2.83.4, and it kinda worked with an unit exported with Retera's Model Studio, but failed miserably with an model downloaded from HiveWorkshop.
